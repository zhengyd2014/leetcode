 *
 * Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's
 * (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You
 * may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
 * 
 * Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no
 * island, the maximum area is 0.)
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 * ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 * ⁠[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 * ⁠[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 * ⁠[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 * ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 * ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 * ⁠[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
 * 
 * Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the
 * island must be connected 4-directionally.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
 * Given the above grid, return 0.
 * 
 * Note: The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.
