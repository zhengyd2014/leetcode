 * In a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a
 * /, \, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous
 * regions.
 * 
 * (Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as
 * "\\".)
 * 
 * Return the number of regions.

 * [
 * " /",
 * "/ "

 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

 * Input:
 * [
 * " /",
 * "  "

 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [
 * "\\/",
 * "/\\"
 * ]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to
 * \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)

 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [
 * "/\\",
 * "\\/"
 * ]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "/\\" refers to
 * /\, and "\\/" refers to \/.)

 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [
 * "//",

 * Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30
 * grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.
