 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3,5,4,7]'
 *
 * 
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous
 * increasing subsequence (subarray).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its
 * length is 3. 
 * Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a
 * continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its
 * length is 1. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
