 *
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
 * to you beforehand.
 * 
 * (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
 * 
 * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its
 * index, otherwise return -1.
 * 
 * You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
