 *
 * Given a m x n grid. Each cell of the grid represents a street. The street of
 * grid[i][j] can be:
 * 
 * 1 which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
 * 2 which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
 * 3 which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
 * 4 which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
 * 5 which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
 * 6 which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell (0,0). A valid
 * path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell (0,0) and
 * ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1). The path should only follow
 * the streets.
 * 
 * Notice that you are not allowed to change any street.
 * 
 * Return true if there is a valid path in the grid or false otherwise.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells
 * of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with
 * any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[1,1,2]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0,
 * 2).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,3]]
 * Output: true
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: grid = [[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[6]]
 * Output: true
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 300
 * 1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6
 *
